# Advanced-Light-Intensity-Indicator-
The ALII module monitors light intensity using an LDR, displaying levels 0-7 on a seven-segment display and an average over time. It promotes energy conservation by optimizing artificial lighting, enhances urban safety, and integrates with solar panels for sustainability. Designed without programmable or pre-built ICs, using gates and flip-flops.
